Compilation needs PCL 1.7 or higher.

This module is used to find possible cylinders within a range and show them on point cloud.
Input needs scaled map and keyframe points from cloud_visualizer.
Dev by Aayush.



Usage:
./treeFit Mode ScaledPointCloud ScaledKeyFrame radiusFromKeyframe

# Mode : -r, -a, -v, -n (these modes are from cloud_visualizer. Use -a to see the cylinders on map points.)
# ScaledPointCloud : Scaled point cloud of map points from cloud_visualizer
# ScaledKeyFrame : Scaled point cloud of keyframe points from cloud_visualizer
# radiusFromKeyFrame : Radius in Meters to search from keyframe location (Camera location). Currently 1.5m radius is used.


Example use:

./treeFit -a scaled_point_cloud.pcd scaled_keyframe.pcd 1.5


STILL UNDER DEV, BUT FEEL FREE TO USE FOR DEBUG. PLEASE MESSAGE AAYUSH IF ANY ISSUES OCCUR
